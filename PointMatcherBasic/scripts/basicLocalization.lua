  Application Name:
  PointMatcherBasic

  Summary:
  Basic object matching using the PointMatcher.

  Description:
  Teaching visually significant points on the teach object and using those to
  find identical objects.

  How to Run:
  Starting this sample is possible either by running the app (F5) or
  debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
  function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
  Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage.
  To run this sample a device with SICK Algorithm API is necessary.
  For example InspectorP or SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the
  Emulator on AppStudio 2.2 or higher can be used.

  More Information:
  Tutorial "Algorithms - Matching".

-- In this sample only rotation and translation changes are expected, no scale or perspective changes
matcher:setPoseType('RIGID')
-- Slight downsampling makes the matching faster and sometimes also more robust as noise is removed
matcher:setDownsampleFactor(2)
-- In this sample it is expected, that the objects are only slightly rotated (30 degrees) relative to the teach object
matcher:setRotationRange(30.0 / (2 * math.pi))
-- A smaller point number than the default (1000) makes the matching faster
matcher:setPointCount(500)
