## PointMatcherBasic
Basic object matching using PointMatcher.
### Description
Teaching visually significant points on the teach object and using those to find identical objects.
### How to Run
Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main' function allows debugging step-by-step after Engine.OnStarted' event. Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage. Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show images after loading the web-page. 
To run this Sample a device with SICK Algorithm API is necessary. For example InspectorP or SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the Emulator on AppStudio 2.2 or higher can be used.
